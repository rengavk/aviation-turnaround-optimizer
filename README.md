## Problem Statement

### Business Scenario
Airline X loses millions of dollars annually due to turnaround delays—the time spent preparing an aircraft for its next flight (cleaning, fueling, boarding, baggage handling, etc.). These delays cause a ripple effect, leading to:
- Missed passenger connections
- Compensation costs
- Reduced fleet utilization
- Decreased customer satisfaction
- Regulatory penalties

**Goal:** Identify the root causes of these delays and build an optimizer that can recommend operational changes to reduce delays by 6–12%.

## Business Impact

### Current State (Based on Analysis)
- **Delay Rate:** 37.33% of flights experience delays >15 minutes
- **Average Delay:** ~25 minutes per delayed flight
- **Estimated Annual Cost:** $50 per delayed flight × 3,733 delays (per 10,000 flights) = **$186,650** per 10,000 flights

### Potential Savings
With a 6-12% reduction in delays:
- **Conservative (6%):** $11,199 savings per 10,000 flights
- **Optimistic (12%):** $22,398 savings per 10,000 flights
- **Annual Savings (for 100,000 flights/year):** $111,990 - $223,980

## Key Performance Indicators

### Primary KPIs
1. **On-Time Performance (OTP):** 62.67% (flights departing within 15 minutes of schedule)
2. **Delay Minutes:** Average 25.1 minutes for delayed flights
3. **Delay Cause Frequency:**
   - Arrival Delay Propagation: 34.9%
   - Total Ground Time: 30.0%
   - Gate Delays: 6.5%
   - Weather Delays: 5.5%
   - Gate Availability: 4.9%

### Top Predictive Features
1. **Arrival Delay** (34.9%) - Incoming flight delays propagate
2. **Total Ground Time** (30.0%) - Sum of all turnaround operations
3. **Gate Delay** (6.5%) - Gate availability issues
4. **Weather Delay** (5.5%) - Adverse weather conditions
5. **Gate Available** (4.9%) - Binary gate availability flag

### Key Insights
- **Delay Propagation:** Incoming delays are the #1 predictor
- **Weather Impact:** Snowy conditions increase delay rate by 3x
- **Gate Management:** Gate unavailability adds 15-30 minutes
- **Critical Path:** Boarding time is the longest single operation

## Methodology

### Step 1: Problem Framing
- Defined business scenario and impact
- Established KPIs (OTP, Delay Minutes, Delay Causes)
- Set target: 6-12% delay reduction

### Step 2: Data Setup
- Generated 10,000 synthetic flight records
- Variables include:
  - Flight operations: cleaning, fueling, boarding, baggage times
  - External factors: weather, gate availability, crew readiness
  - Temporal features: hour, day of week, month

### Step 3: Feature Engineering
Created advanced features:
- **Buffer Times:** Deviation from expected operation times
- **Congestion Level:** Flights per hour at the airport
- **Weather Index:** Numeric severity encoding
- **Delay Propagation:** Incoming flight delay impact
- **Critical Path Time:** Maximum of parallel operations

### Step 4: Modeling
- **Random Forest:** Feature importance and robust predictions
- **XGBoost:** High-accuracy predictions with SHAP interpretability
